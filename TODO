Enhancements:
- Mode-dependent background color?
- Document all public functions.
- Make an optional feature to show (part of) the directory path of named buffers.
- Make an optional feature to show uppercase marks in each buffer.
- Maybe show the Current Working Directory somewhere.

Bugs:
- Remove crazy hack with global var to detect filtering windows. Should use eventignore
  and raise the appropriate autocmds (BufEnter mainly) when the buffer is set up fully.
  set eventignore=all, new, yadda yadda, store bufnr, wincmd c, reset ei, wincmd s,
  load buffer
- Showing three windows, the center window being an unlisted buffer. Now close
  that window -> lost. Possible countermeasure: whenever entering a whitespace
  buffer, detect panic (#windows < 3) and jump to some known buffer and reset the
  view.
